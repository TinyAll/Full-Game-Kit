// LocalizationReadMe.txt
// Don't forget to add a localization text file to the StartUp script in the StartUp scene.
// Otherwise you will not be able to access it from the immediate start of the game.

// If you want to localize images, this can only be sprites located in the specified folder.
FilePath = Sprites/Branding/
// This will replace the sprite of the gameobject that contains an XLocalize with the key 'Image' with a sprite file named "Sprites/Branding/TestImage"
Image = TestImage
// You can add \n linebreaks.
Test1 = Hello\nHelloExample
Test2 = TestCheckTest
Test3 = Please note the follow thing.
Test4 = Watch out for spaces in the end of the row
// I think  adding color tages in the text also works. Needs checking.
